# Medical_Models
Using ML and DL for making models to simplify / aid in diagnonizing issues.

Here, we will be using many datasets available freely online and from there we try simplify the work and maximize the accuracy, therby exploring the great things the booming AI industry is showing (and maybe if after a lot of testing also be used in real world.)

For now, I shall be uploading one as data processing takes a lot of time in colab. For a small one(i.e. the pneumonia dataset) took nearly a fifth of a day just for 200 epochs but I am grateful it worked out as the efficiency for it was over 90%.
