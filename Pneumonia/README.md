I would at first here thank Kaggle for helping me get the Data for my model, and then Google and Stack Overflow for helping me diagnose many errors I faced during the creation of this model.
Now I have saved the models in various extension formats which might be of use to you. So, instead of rerunning the notebook you could just use it by uploading it to your notebook and start computing/testing.
For the syntax for those you could easily find it on Google.com or Stack Overflow.
